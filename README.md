# while-loop-3

I was given the following task for a university test:

Question 1
Students have done two tests, each marked out of 50. Grades are awarded on the basis of the combined total (the scores on both tests added together) as follows:

 0 -  49  Fail
50 -  69  Pass
70 - 100  Distinction
A lecturer wishes to be able to put the students' marks into a computer, like this:

Next student (first test): 29
(second test): 34
Next student (first test): 13
(second test): 10
Next student (first test): 36
(second test): 45
(...)


and so on, ending with 51 and 51 to indicate the end of the data; and have the computer output the number of distinctions, the number of passes, and the number of failures, in that order. Write a Python program to do this. (You may assume that the lecturer enters the data correctly, i.e., all values are integers between 0 and 51.)
